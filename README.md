# ðŸš€ Welcome to your new awesome project!

Using webpack to build a pure vanilla js project (written in modern js (es6+ and so babel is used) using ES6 modules but using commonjs modules from npm repository)
For creating custom production and development builds, piggy backing on the --env parameter of webpack to change the webpack configuration object .
Another way to do it is here https://webpack.js.org/configuration/mode/

```
npm run build
```

or

```
yarn build
```

to bundle your application
